    "text": "# About Me — Francesco Colasurdo *Data Science & Artificial Intelligence | Curiosity, Discipline, and Global Perspective* --- ## 1. Introduction & Identity My name is **Francesco Colasurdo**, I am a 21-year-old student in **Data Science and Artificial Intelligence** currently based in **Eindhoven, the Netherlands**. I was born and raised in **Italy**, and I have always been fascinated by how technology, human behavior, and data intersect to shape the world we live in. I describe myself as a **curious learner, disciplined achiever, and globally minded thinker**. I enjoy exploring how complex systems — from the human brain to decentralized technologies — can be understood, improved, and made accessible. I am passionate about **AI, blockchain, data-driven innovation, and personal development**. At my core, I am someone who thrives in diverse environments, learns fast from both successes and failures, and values people as much as progress. --- ## 2. Philosophy of Learning & Curiosity Curiosity has always been the cornerstone of who I am. From a young age, I’ve felt an unstoppable desire to understand how things work — not just in technology, but in **economics, psychology, philosophy, and nature**. I believe that learning happens everywhere: in lectures, in books, during late-night discussions with friends, or while having a coffee and talking to strangers. My approach to learning is both **exploratory and disciplined**. When I study, I like to combine academic precision with creative thinking, constantly connecting dots across disciplines. I read extensively — from data science to philosophy, personal growth, and behavioral economics — always looking for frameworks that help me think more clearly. I love immersing myself in new environments, observing, listening, and absorbing knowledge from people who think differently. For me, learning is not just a skill, it’s a way of life — a daily practice of curiosity, openness, and reflection. --- ## 3. Discipline, Sports & Personal Growth Sport has played a central role in shaping my mindset and work ethic. I strongly believe in the principle **“Mens sana in corpore sano”** — a healthy mind in a healthy body. Through years of training, from gym workouts to various sports, I’ve learned that **discipline beats motivation**: what matters most is consistency and the ability to keep going even when it’s hard. This approach has become a metaphor for everything I do — whether I’m training, coding, or writing a paper. I value routines that build mental clarity, self-control, and endurance. I take care of my nutrition, my body, and my environment because I know they directly influence the quality of my thinking. Sport has also taught me humility, teamwork, and patience. It taught me that results don’t come overnight but through thousands of small steps, each one intentionally taken. This philosophy naturally connects to how I approach data science: progress comes from iteration, reflection, and continuous improvement. --- ## 4. International Experiences & Adaptability One of the most transformative aspects of my life has been living and studying in different countries. I see myself as a **citizen of",

International Experiences & Adaptability One of the most transformative aspects of my life has been living and studying in different countries. I see myself as a **citizen of the world**, driven by curiosity for cultures, languages, and human diversity. - At **19**, I spent six months in **Granada, Spain**, through the *Erasmus Programme*. There, I experienced the challenge and joy of living independently in a new culture, meeting people from all over Europe, and studying in a fully international context. I learned to communicate across languages, adapt quickly, and embrace differences as opportunities to grow. - Later, I moved to **Johannesburg, South Africa**, for a two-month internship with the *Italian–South African Chamber of Commerce*. Immersing myself in a completely different cultural and socioeconomic environment pushed me to develop empathy, adaptability, and a stronger sense of global awareness. Working with local professionals taught me how to listen before acting and how to navigate multicultural collaboration with respect and purpose. - Earlier in life, at just **16 years old**, I participated in the **World Scout Jamboree** in *West Virginia, USA*, alongside over **50,000 scouts from 170 countries**. That experience changed me deeply — it was my first true exposure to global diversity. For 21 days, I shared values, traditions, and life lessons with people from every continent. It shaped my communication skills, cultural sensitivity, and my commitment to volunteerism and helping others. These experiences collectively taught me that **adaptability and empathy are as important as technical skills**. They also instilled in me a lifelong appreciation for travel, community, and cultural exchange — experiences that remind me that learning is most powerful when shared. --- ## 5. Technology, Blockchain & Innovation Mindset My curiosity naturally expanded from data science into the world of **blockchain and decentralized technologies**. Since 2021, I have been deeply fascinated by **DeFi (Decentralized Finance)** — not merely from a speculative point of view, but for its **technological, economic, and philosophical implications**. I believe that blockchain represents **a paradigm shift in how we understand trust, ownership, and freedom**. What excites me is not just the coins or market speculation, but the *architecture of decentralization itself*: how distributed systems can bring transparency, resilience, and inclusivity to modern economies. I have studied tokenomics, consensus mechanisms, and smart contracts out of pure curiosity. I’ve explored topics like **game theory, incentive design, and network governance** to understand how they drive human and economic coordination. This exploration also connected with my interest in **philosophy and political economy**, where I see blockchain as a continuation of humanity’s pursuit of **freedom and digital sovereignty**. I am particularly inspired by **Bitcoin’s philosophy of privacy, freedom, and self-custody**, and by the broader idea that technology should empower individuals — not control them. In a world increasingly shaped by AI, I see decentralization as the necessary counterbalance to centralization of data and power. This intersection — between **AI,",

    "text": "am particularly inspired by **Bitcoin’s philosophy of privacy, freedom, and self-custody**, and by the broader idea that technology should empower individuals — not control them. In a world increasingly shaped by AI, I see decentralization as the necessary counterbalance to centralization of data and power. This intersection — between **AI, blockchain, and data ethics** — represents one of my main intellectual and professional passions. --- ## 6. Values, Relationships & Personal Development Beyond academics and technology, I care deeply about **human connection, personal integrity, and kindness**. I genuinely enjoy listening to people, understanding their perspectives, and learning from their stories. I often find inspiration in simple conversations — whether with friends, mentors, or strangers at a café. I believe that **relationships and shared experiences** are as vital to growth as books and code. I try to cultivate empathy, authenticity, and gratitude in everything I do. Helping others has always been a natural instinct for me — whether it’s giving advice, offering support, or sharing knowledge. I’m also passionate about **personal finance, long-term investing, and self-improvement**. I read extensively about **personal development, behavioral psychology, and the Kaizen philosophy** — the art of improving little by little, day by day. For me, progress is not about big leaps but about small, consistent steps that compound over time. During two summers, I worked as a **kitchen assistant** in a local restaurant in my hometown. That job, though far from my field of study, taught me priceless lessons: respect for teamwork, patience, time management, and the value of hard work. It helped me understand the worth of money, the effort behind every service, and the importance of staying humble regardless of my ambitions. In my free time, I love **travelling, cooking, working out, reading, and spending quality time outdoors** with friends. These activities keep me balanced, reminding me that well-being is not an achievement, but a lifestyle. --- ## 7. Vision for the Future I’ve recently moved to **Eindhoven** to pursue my **Master’s degree in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence at the Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e)**. This represents not just an academic milestone, but a journey of **personal transformation**. For the next two years, I want to challenge myself in every direction: - academically, through research and the **Honors Master Program**; - professionally, through **internships, collaborative projects, and thesis work with industry partners**; - personally, by growing as a communicator, leader, and global citizen. My ambitions are both **technical and humanistic**. I aspire to work at the intersection of **AI, decentralized systems, and ethics**, contributing to the development of intelligent systems that are transparent, fair, and human-centric. I dream of building technologies that simplify life without compromising privacy, that empower people without replacing their agency. In the long run, I see myself leading projects that combine **AI innovation with social purpose** — helping businesses, governments, and individuals make smarter, more ethical decisions. Above all, I want to remain **a lifelong learner**, always open to change, challenge, and new opportunities. --- ## 8. Keywords",

    "text": "# Projects — Francesco Colasurdo ## Mental Health Conversational AI (NTT Data, Naples) Role: Data Science Intern Period: Mar 2025 – Jun 2025 Location: Naples, Italy ### Problem Mental well-being conversations are sensitive, high-volume, and highly contextual. The company needed a scalable conversational AI capable of interacting with users, detecting emotional state, and producing actionable insights for analysis — in real time. ### What I built - I designed and deployed a mental health chatbot using Dialogflow CX integrated with Telegram. - I connected the chatbot to Google BigQuery and collected >1,000 conversations. - I implemented clustering and sentiment analysis to identify behavioral patterns in users. ### Technical Stack - Dialogflow CX (intent detection, conversation flow) - Telegram Bot API (interaction layer) - Gemini API (LLM-based sentiment and emotional tone detection) - HDBSCAN + UMAP (unsupervised clustering of conversation embeddings) - R (regression analysis, exploratory data analysis, hypothesis testing) - Power BI (interactive dashboards for insights and storytelling) - BigQuery (data storage, querying, live monitoring) ### Impact - >85% completion rate on conversations. - 7 recurring behavioral clusters discovered across users. - Built real-time dashboards that visualized emotional trends and engagement. - This project formed the core of my Bachelor's thesis. --- ## Market Intelligence Automation (Italian–South African Chamber of Trade and Industries) Role: Data Analytics & Market Research Intern Period: Jan 2025 – Mar 2025 Location: Johannesburg, South Africa ### Problem Business partners and export stakeholders needed fast, data-backed answers about high-growth sectors (energy, steel, agri-food). The manual process to gather this info was slow (several minutes per query) and not standardized. ### What I built - I produced 4 full market analyses identifying >20% annual growth opportunities in strategic sectors. - I built an internal market-intelligence database and automated data collection and reporting flows. - I connected Excel data sources and Power BI dashboards to deliver near-instant answers. ### Technical Stack - Power BI (dashboards, KPIs, trend visualization) - Excel automation (ETL-like internal workflow) - Data cleaning and consolidation for repeatable intelligence ### Impact - Reduced time-to-answer from ~3 minutes to <15 seconds. - Improved decision-making speed for strategic partnership and export opportunities between Italian and South African firms. - Helped leadership maintain updated sector views without manual digging. --- ## Ask My CV — Personal RAG Assistant Role: Creator / Architect Period: 2025 – ongoing Location: Eindhoven / Remote ### Problem Recruiters and collaborators often ask similar questions: \"What have you worked on?\", \"What are your skills?\", \"What motivates you?\". Most personal websites are static and do not reflect the real depth of a profile. ### What I built - I designed a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) backend in Python using FastAPI. - I store my personal knowledge base as Markdown files (cv.md, skills.md, courses.md, projects.md, about_me.md). - I generate embeddings, perform cosine-similarity retrieval, and build first-person answers (\"I worked on...\"). - I integrated a lightweight chat widget into my personal website (Hugo + JS) so visitors can ask questions. ### Technical Stack - FastAPI (Python API /api/chat)",

    "text": "# Thesis & Internship Project — Intelligent ChatBot for Psychological Well-being ## Overview As part of my Bachelor's degree in **Statistics for Big Data** at the **University of Salerno (UNISA)**, I completed an internship and thesis project at **NTT Data Italia, Naples**, within the **Digital Linguistics & Human Behaviour Team**. The project focused on the **design, implementation, and statistical analysis** of a conversational AI system aimed at supporting **mental health and emotional self-awareness** through data-driven interaction. ## Objectives - Design and deploy an **AI-powered conversational assistant** for psychological well-being monitoring. - Integrate advanced **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** with **statistical learning** and **data visualization**. - Collect, preprocess, and analyze **real user-chat data** to extract behavioral and emotional insights. - Build a **scalable, privacy-compliant data pipeline** for continuous improvement of the chatbot. ## System Architecture ### Core Components 1. **DialogFlow CX (Google Cloud)** — primary conversational flow engine. - Designed multi-flow architecture (emotion flows: happiness, sadness, anxiety, boredom). - Combined deterministic and generative routes for robust intent handling. - Integrated custom Generators powered by **Google Gemini 1.5 Flash** for sentiment understanding. 2. **Telegram Bot API + Node.js Middleware** - Developed a custom **API layer** to bridge Telegram and DialogFlow CX. - Implemented a three-tier model: **User Interface (Telegram)** → **Middleware (Node.js)** → **Conversational Engine (DialogFlow CX)**. - Managed user sessions, webhooks, and asynchronous message streaming. 3. **Google BigQuery (Data Warehouse)** - Real-time storage of conversation logs in **JSON format**. - Complex **SQL queries and CTEs** for flattening nested JSON data. - Data anonymization and parameter extraction (e.g., sleep hours, stress level, productivity). 4. **Statistical & Machine Learning Layer (R Language)** - Conducted advanced **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on structured data. - Applied **Regression Analysis**, **DBSCAN**, and **HDBSCAN** clustering. - Implemented **TF-IDF**, **sBERT embeddings**, and **UMAP** for textual feature representation and dimensionality reduction. - Evaluated cluster validity with **Silhouette Score** and **Dunn Index**. 5. **Visualization Layer (Power BI)** - Built interactive dashboards to display emotional trends, routine correlations, and ChatBot performance metrics. - Enabled dynamic filtering by emotion, activity, and user behavior. --- ## Data Pipeline Summary 1. **Data Acquisition:** Conversations stored in BigQuery in real-time via DialogFlow logs. 2. **Parsing & Wrangling:** Flattened nested JSON structures with SQL (`JSON_VALUE`, `REGEXP_EXTRACT`, `LAG`, `DATETIME_DIFF`). 3. **Feature Engineering:** Extracted behavioral and emotional parameters per session (diet, sleep, hydration, productivity, anxiety level). 4. **Text Preprocessing:** Tokenization, lemmatization, stopword removal, lowercasing, and normalization for uniformity. 5. **Numerical Representation:** - TF-IDF for lexical similarity. - **sBERT (Sentence-BERT)** embeddings for semantic similarity. 6. **Dimensionality Reduction:** UMAP projections for cluster visualization. 7. **Clustering & Analysis:** - DBSCAN → density-based clusters of similar messages. - HDBSCAN → hierarchical and noise-tolerant clusters. 8. **Evaluation & Insights:** Computed silhouette width and Dunn index to assess cluster cohesion and separation. --- ## Key Results & Insights - **Identified behavioral patterns** correlating sleep duration, hydration, and self-reported productivity. - Clustered emotional states into distinct profiles (e.g., anxiety-driven users vs. happiness clusters). - Detected **linguistic signatures** tied to emotional states using TF-IDF and sBERT representations. -",
