Francesco Colasurdo — Goal Setting Framework & Roadmap
Philosophy & Mindset
For me, setting goals is not just about competition; it is fundamentally about continuous self-improvement. My overarching objective is to become a better person, step by step, day by day.

I approach personal and professional growth with the same analytical rigor I apply to Data Science. I structure my roadmap around University Quarters. This alignment helps me maintain order and clarity regarding timelines, ensuring that my academic commitments and personal ambitions proceed in parallel without friction.

Methodology: The "Quarterly Quantifiable" Approach
I believe that an ambition remains a dream until it is measured. My process for defining goals follows a strict protocol:

1. Definition & KPIs
Once an ambition is identified, I establish concrete, refutable KPIs (Key Performance Indicators).

Example: Instead of a vague goal like "lose weight," I define the target explicitly: "Lose X kg by [Date]."

The difference between losing 0.1kg and 10kg is magnitude; clarity prevents ambiguity in success measurement.

2. Actionable Sub-Goals
After setting the KPI, I reverse-engineer the path to success. I break the main objective down into "sub-goals" or actionable steps. These steps must also be quantitative and verifiable to track progress in real-time.

3. Review & Retrospective
At the end of every Quarter, I conduct a performance review.

Success: Celebrating the achievement of the desired outcome.

Failure Analysis: If a goal is not reached, I categorize the root cause to determine the next step:

Cause A (Resource Constraint): I didn't dedicate enough time or energy. -> Action: Repropose the goal for the next Quarter with better planning.

Cause B (Procrastination/Lack of Interest): I kept postponing it because I didn't want to do it. -> Action: My experience suggests the best solution here is delegation (whenever possible), rather than forcing execution.
