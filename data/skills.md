## 🧠 Programming & Software Development

- **Python:** My main language for data analysis, machine learning, and backend development.  
  Experienced with Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Hugging Face, and FastAPI.  
  Developed multiple projects including an AI-powered mental health chatbot using Dialogflow CX and Gemini APIs.

- **R:** Used extensively for statistical modeling, regression, and visualization (ggplot2, Shiny, RMarkdown).  
  Applied R for exploratory data analysis and clustering in my dissertation project.

- **SQL:** Strong command of relational queries and database design.  
  Worked with MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Google BigQuery for building data pipelines and analytical dashboards.

- **JavaScript & HTML/CSS:** Basic knowledge for front-end integration of interactive components (e.g., embedding chat widgets in my Hugo portfolio).

- **Version Control:** Experienced with Git and GitHub for collaborative development and workflow management.

## 📊 Data Science & Machine Learning

- **Supervised Learning:** Proficient with linear/logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, XGBoost, and support vector machines.  
  Experienced in training and validating models using cross-validation and grid search.

- **Unsupervised Learning:** Skilled in clustering (K-means, HDBSCAN, hierarchical) and dimensionality reduction (PCA, UMAP).  
  Applied clustering and topic modeling to identify behavioral patterns in user conversation data.

- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):**  
  Experience with text preprocessing, sentiment analysis, and large language models (Gemini, OpenAI GPT, Hugging Face Transformers).  
  Built an NLP-driven chatbot capable of emotion-aware interaction and contextual responses.

- **Model Evaluation:** Use of metrics such as accuracy, F1-score, RMSE, and silhouette score to assess model performance.  
  Comfortable with statistical validation and visualization of model results.
