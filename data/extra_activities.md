# Scouting Experience

I was part of **AGESCI (Italian Catholic Scout Association)** from age **7 to 19**, living through all the stages: **Cub Scouts (Lupetti)**, **Explorers (Reparto)**, **Novitiate**, and **Clan**.  
Each phase shaped who I am — my values, mindset, and human skills.

During my years in the Scouts, I learned to **grow personally**, **develop transversal and social skills**, and **build deep, meaningful relationships** that still matter in my everyday life.

## Cub Scouts
Inspired by *The Jungle Book*, I learned the importance of **teamwork**, **fair play**, and **helping others**.  
Being part of a “pack” of thirty children taught me to **communicate**, **respect rules**, and **support the group**.

## Explorers
This phase was the most formative.  
I learned to **live and collaborate** in small teams called *patrols* (about seven people), each with specific roles and responsibilities.  
We worked to make our patrols efficient, not through toxic competition but through **healthy self-improvement** and **mutual support**.

### Skills developed
- **Survival and orientation**
- **Adaptability**
- **Leadership and responsibility**
- **Environmental respect**

I also experienced my **first independence**, camping outdoors, building tents, and cooking over fire.

At **15 years old**, I was selected as an **ambassador for Italy** at the **24th World Scout Jamboree** in **West Virginia, USA**, joining **50,000 Scouts** from all over the world — an unforgettable global experience of **cultural exchange and shared values**.

## Novitiate and Clan
In this phase, the focus shifted back to **community and society**.  
Together with my group, we engaged in **volunteer work** and **self-funding projects** to support our Scout activities.

We volunteered in **nursing homes**, and helped **children with free tutoring**.  
Self-funding taught me the **value of money**, **team effort**, **resourcefulness**, and **goal-oriented collaboration**.  
All our projects financed our summer camps and Scout activities.

Scouting deeply shaped my **ethics**, **discipline**, and **interpersonal skills**.  
It gave me a foundation of **time management**, **organization**, **teamwork**, **loyalty**, and **integrity** — values I carry every day.  
Once a Scout, always a Scout.

# Sports and Physical Activity

I’ve never believed I had a natural talent for any single sport, yet I’ve always been **passionate about physical activity**.  
I’ve tried many disciplines — **rowing, soccer, volleyball, athletics** — but during university, I started focusing on the **gym**, adapting it better to my routine.

Sports taught me that **talent and motivation aren’t enough**.  
The real key is **consistency and discipline** — showing up even when I don’t feel like it.  
Through time and dedication, I learned the power of **compound interest in effort**: small, steady actions create great results.

Following a **structured diet**, maintaining a **healthy lifestyle**, and training regularly strengthened my **mental resilience** and **self-control**.  
These habits positively impact my **studies**, **projects**, and **relationships**.

Living healthily makes me feel **alive, focused, and proud**.  
I truly believe in *“Mens sana in corpore sano”* — a sound mind in a sound body.

# Reading and Writing

Recently, I’ve been nurturing a passion for **reading and writing** — habits that make me feel more **conscious and self-aware**.  
Through books, articles, and blogs, I can **live multiple lives**, **learn from others’ experiences**, and **avoid their mistakes**.

Reading gives me **different life perspectives**, helps me **develop critical thinking**, and refine my **personal vision and mission**.

That’s why I started writing too.  
Through my **stories and reflections**, often shared via blogs or social media posts, I hope to **inspire readers** or **spark new thoughts** — whether they agree or not.

I believe that **personal and social progress** comes from **dialogue and self-questioning**.  
Without openness, there’s no growth.

Writing helps me **clarify my thoughts**, **organize ideas**, and **find peace**.  
Putting goals on paper and crossing them off once achieved gives me a sense of **accomplishment and purpose** that mental notes never could.

# Cooking and Culinary Passion

My mother calls me *“a good fork”* — someone who truly appreciates food.  
Since childhood, that passion led me to **experiment with new recipes** and **fall in love with cooking**.

Watching **MasterChef** and cooking with my **grandmother** fueled my curiosity.  
I started cooking for my family, enjoying the act of **creating something special for others**.

During high school summers, I worked in **two restaurants in Salerno**, where I learned:
- How to **collaborate in a professional kitchen**
- The **value of hard work and money**
- How to **respect time and effort**

Those experiences taught me that **every task has worth** and **teamwork drives success**.

Even today, when I have free time, I love **hosting dinners for friends**, sharing my latest recipes.  
For me, cooking isn’t just about food — it’s an **act of love**, a **way to connect** and **express gratitude** toward the people I care about.
