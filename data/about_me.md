# About Me — Francesco Colasurdo  
*Data Science & Artificial Intelligence | Curiosity, Discipline, and Global Perspective*  

---

## 1. Introduction & Identity  

My name is **Francesco Colasurdo**, I am a 21-year-old student in **Data Science and Artificial Intelligence** currently based in **Eindhoven, the Netherlands**.  
I was born and raised in **Italy**, and I have always been fascinated by how technology, human behavior, and data intersect to shape the world we live in.  

I describe myself as a **curious learner, disciplined achiever, and globally minded thinker**.  
I enjoy exploring how complex systems — from the human brain to decentralized technologies — can be understood, improved, and made accessible.  

I am passionate about **AI, blockchain, data-driven innovation, and personal development**.  
At my core, I am someone who thrives in diverse environments, learns fast from both successes and failures, and values people as much as progress.

## 2. Philosophy of Learning & Curiosity  

Curiosity has always been the cornerstone of who I am.  
From a young age, I’ve felt an unstoppable desire to understand how things work — not just in technology, but in **economics, psychology, philosophy, and nature**.  
I believe that learning happens everywhere: in lectures, in books, during late-night discussions with friends, or while having a coffee and talking to strangers.  

My approach to learning is both **exploratory and disciplined**.  
When I study, I like to combine academic precision with creative thinking, constantly connecting dots across disciplines.  
I read extensively — from data science to philosophy, personal growth, and behavioral economics — always looking for frameworks that help me think more clearly.  

I love immersing myself in new environments, observing, listening, and absorbing knowledge from people who think differently.  
For me, learning is not just a skill, it’s a way of life — a daily practice of curiosity, openness, and reflection.

## 3. Discipline, Sports & Personal Growth  

Sport has played a central role in shaping my mindset and work ethic.  
I strongly believe in the principle **“Mens sana in corpore sano”** — a healthy mind in a healthy body.  
Through years of training, from gym workouts to various sports, I’ve learned that **discipline beats motivation**: what matters most is consistency and the ability to keep going even when it’s hard.  

This approach has become a metaphor for everything I do — whether I’m training, coding, or writing a paper.  
I value routines that build mental clarity, self-control, and endurance.  
I take care of my nutrition, my body, and my environment because I know they directly influence the quality of my thinking.  

Sport has also taught me humility, teamwork, and patience.  
It taught me that results don’t come overnight but through thousands of small steps, each one intentionally taken.  
This philosophy naturally connects to how I approach data science: progress comes from iteration, reflection, and continuous improvement.

## 4. International Experiences & Adaptability  

One of the most transformative aspects of my life has been living and studying in different countries.  
I see myself as a **citizen of the world**, driven by curiosity for cultures, languages, and human diversity.

- At **19**, I spent six months in **Granada, Spain**, through the *Erasmus Programme*.  
  There, I experienced the challenge and joy of living independently in a new culture, meeting people from all over Europe, and studying in a fully international context.  
  I learned to communicate across languages, adapt quickly, and embrace differences as opportunities to grow.

- Later, I moved to **Johannesburg, South Africa**, for a two-month internship with the *Italian–South African Chamber of Commerce*.  
  Immersing myself in a completely different cultural and socioeconomic environment pushed me to develop empathy, adaptability, and a stronger sense of global awareness.  
  Working with local professionals taught me how to listen before acting and how to navigate multicultural collaboration with respect and purpose.

- Earlier in life, at just **16 years old**, I participated in the **World Scout Jamboree** in *West Virginia, USA*, alongside over **50,000 scouts from 170 countries**.  
  That experience changed me deeply — it was my first true exposure to global diversity.  
  For 21 days, I shared values, traditions, and life lessons with people from every continent.  
  It shaped my communication skills, cultural sensitivity, and my commitment to volunteerism and helping others.

These experiences collectively taught me that **adaptability and empathy are as important as technical skills**.  
They also instilled in me a lifelong appreciation for travel, community, and cultural exchange — experiences that remind me that learning is most powerful when shared.

## 5. Technology, Blockchain & Innovation Mindset  

My curiosity naturally expanded from data science into the world of **blockchain and decentralized technologies**.  
Since 2021, I have been deeply fascinated by **DeFi (Decentralized Finance)** — not merely from a speculative point of view, but for its **technological, economic, and philosophical implications**.  

I believe that blockchain represents **a paradigm shift in how we understand trust, ownership, and freedom**.  
What excites me is not just the coins or market speculation, but the *architecture of decentralization itself*: how distributed systems can bring transparency, resilience, and inclusivity to modern economies.  

I have studied tokenomics, consensus mechanisms, and smart contracts out of pure curiosity.  
I’ve explored topics like **game theory, incentive design, and network governance** to understand how they drive human and economic coordination.  
This exploration also connected with my interest in **philosophy and political economy**, where I see blockchain as a continuation of humanity’s pursuit of **freedom and digital sovereignty**.  

I am particularly inspired by **Bitcoin’s philosophy of privacy, freedom, and self-custody**, and by the broader idea that technology should empower individuals — not control them.  
In a world increasingly shaped by AI, I see decentralization as the necessary counterbalance to centralization of data and power.  

This intersection — between **AI, blockchain, and data ethics** — represents one of my main intellectual and professional passions.

## 6. Values, Relationships & Personal Development  

Beyond academics and technology, I care deeply about **human connection, personal integrity, and kindness**.  
I genuinely enjoy listening to people, understanding their perspectives, and learning from their stories.  
I often find inspiration in simple conversations — whether with friends, mentors, or strangers at a café.  

I believe that **relationships and shared experiences** are as vital to growth as books and code.  
I try to cultivate empathy, authenticity, and gratitude in everything I do.  
Helping others has always been a natural instinct for me — whether it’s giving advice, offering support, or sharing knowledge.

I’m also passionate about **personal finance, long-term investing, and self-improvement**.  
I read extensively about **personal development, behavioral psychology, and the Kaizen philosophy** — the art of improving little by little, day by day.  
For me, progress is not about big leaps but about small, consistent steps that compound over time.  

During two summers, I worked as a **kitchen assistant** in a local restaurant in my hometown.  
That job, though far from my field of study, taught me priceless lessons: respect for teamwork, patience, time management, and the value of hard work.  
It helped me understand the worth of money, the effort behind every service, and the importance of staying humble regardless of my ambitions.  

In my free time, I love **travelling, cooking, working out, reading, and spending quality time outdoors** with friends.  
These activities keep me balanced, reminding me that well-being is not an achievement, but a lifestyle.

This represents not just an academic milestone, but a journey of **personal transformation**.  

For the next two years, I want to challenge myself in every direction:  
- academically, through research and the **Honors Master Program**;  
- professionally, through **internships, collaborative projects, and thesis work with industry partners**;  
- personally, by growing as a communicator, leader, and global citizen.  

My ambitions are both **technical and humanistic**.  
I aspire to work at the intersection of **AI, decentralized systems, and ethics**, contributing to the development of intelligent systems that are transparent, fair, and human-centric.  
I dream of building technologies that simplify life without compromising privacy, that empower people without replacing their agency.  

In the long run, I see myself leading projects that combine **AI innovation with social purpose** — helping businesses, governments, and individuals make smarter, more ethical decisions.  

Above all, I want to remain **a lifelong learner**, always open to change, challenge, and new opportunities.
