# Ask My CV — Personal RAG Assistant

This repository contains the backend for **“Ask My CV”**, an AI assistant that answers questions about me — *as if I were responding in first person* — by retrieving information directly from my real CV and experience.

> **Live:** Deployed on [Render](https://render.com) and connected to my [personal website](https://kaj04.github.io/Francesco-Colasurdo-Website/), where visitors and recruiters can chat with the assistant.

## How It Works

1. **Knowledge Base**  
   All my professional information (experience, education, skills, values, projects) lives as markdown files under `/data/*.md`.

2. **Index Building** — `build_index.py`  
   - Loads every markdown file  
   - Splits content into overlapping chunks  
   - Generates dense embeddings with **Sentence-Transformers**  
   - Saves them to `vectors.json`

3. **TF-IDF Index (Hybrid Search)** — `build_tfidf.py`  
   - Reads the same chunks from `vectors.json`  
   - Builds a **TF-IDF matrix** (`tfidf_matrix.npz`)  
   - Enables **hybrid retrieval** by combining keyword and semantic similarity

4. **Retriever** — `retriever.py`  
   - Embeds the user query with the same model used for the index  
   - Retrieves the top chunks using cosine similarity  
   - (If TF-IDF files are present) performs **hybrid fusion** via **Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF)**  
   - Returns the top-K most relevant chunks for the final answer

5. **Agent & API**  
   - `agent.py`: crafts a structured prompt (“speak as Francesco, do not invent”)  
   - `server.py`: FastAPI app exposing `POST /api/chat`, used by the website widget

## Goal

Enable visitors and recruiters to ask natural questions like:

> “What did you build at NTT Data?”  
> “What are your strongest skills?”  
> “What motivates you?”

…and receive honest, first-person answers drawn directly from my verified experience and personal data — *never hallucinated*.
